sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: This sorting algorithm is much faster when the data is already sorted.
This is because bubble sort will have its sorter count as 0 at the end of thhe first run through of the numbers.
The will know computer that the numbers are already in order and ending the program.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:This was the fastest algorithm consistently over each type of data set. It was also relatively consistent no matter if
the data was in otder, reversed or random.

sort3 uses: selection sort
How do you know?: This algorithm too a medium amount of time and was similar no matter what order the data was in. This is because
selection has to go from the start to the end even if the data is in order.
